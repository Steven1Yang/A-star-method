# ðŸ§© 15 Puzzle Solver with A* Algorithm

This project implements the **A\*** (A-star) search algorithm to solve the classic **15-puzzle** (sliding tile puzzle). It uses an admissible heuristic (Manhattan distance) to find the optimal solution efficiently.

## ðŸ“Œ What is the 15-Puzzle?

The 15-puzzle is a 4x4 grid containing 15 numbered tiles and one empty space. The objective is to slide the tiles into the correct order:
